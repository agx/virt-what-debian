=head1 NAME

virt-what - detect if we are running in a virtual machine

=head1 SUMMARY

virt-what [options]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<virt-what> is a shell script which can be used to detect if the
program is running in a virtual machine.

The program prints out a list of "facts" about the virtual machine,
derived from heuristics.  One fact is printed per line.

If nothing is printed and the script exits with code 0 (no error),
then it can mean I<either> that the program is running on bare-metal
I<or> the program is running inside a type of virtual machine which we
don't know about or cannot detect.

=head1 FACTS

=over 4

=item B<hyperv>

This is Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=item B<ibm_systemz>

This is an IBM SystemZ (or other S/390) hardware partitioning system.
Additional facts listed below may also be printed.

=item B<ibm_systemz-direct>

This is Linux running directly on a IBM SystemZ hardware partitioning
system.

This is expected to be a highly unusual configuration - if
you see this result you should treat it with suspicion.

Status: not confirmed

=item B<ibm_systemz-lpar>

This is Linux running directly on an LPAR on an IBM SystemZ
hardware partitioning system.

Status: not confirmed

=item B<ibm_systemz-zvm>

This is a z/VM guest running in an LPAR on an IBM SystemZ
hardware partitioning system.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ using a Fedora guest running in z/VM

=item B<linux_vserver>

This process is running in a Linux VServer container.

Status: contributed by Barış Metin

=item B<kvm>

This guest is running on the KVM hypervisor using hardware
acceleration.

Note that if the hypervisor is using software acceleration
you should I<not> see this, but should see the C<qemu> fact
instead.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ.

=item B<openvz>

The guest appears to be running inside an OpenVZ or Virtuozzo
container.

Status: contributed by Evgeniy Sokolov

=item B<parallels>

The guest is running inside Parallels Virtual Platform
(Parallels Desktop, Parallels Server).

Status: contributed by Justin Clift

=item B<powervm_lx86>

The guest is running inside IBM PowerVM Lx86 Linux/x86 emulator.

Status: data supplied by Jeffrey Scheel, not confirmed

=item B<qemu>

This is QEMU hypervisor using software emulation.

Note that for KVM (hardware accelerated) guests you should I<not> see
this.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ.

=item B<uml>

This is a User-Mode Linux (UML) guest.

Status: contributed by Laurent Léonard

=item B<virtage>

This is Hitachi Virtualization Manager (HVM) Virtage
hardware partitioning system.

Status: data supplied by Bhavna Sarathy, not confirmed

=item B<virtualbox>

This is a VirtualBox guest.

Status: contributed by Laurent Léonard

=item B<virtualpc>

The guest appears to be running on Microsoft VirtualPC.

Status: not confirmed

=item B<vmware>

The guest appears to be running on VMware hypervisor.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=item B<xen>

The guest appears to be running on Xen hypervisor.

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=item B<xen-dom0>

This is the Xen dom0 (privileged domain).

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=item B<xen-domU>

This is a Xen domU (paravirtualized guest domain).

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=item B<xen-hvm>

This is a Xen guest fully virtualized (HVM).

Status: confirmed by RWMJ

=head1 IMPORTANT NOTE

Most of the time, using this program is the I<wrong> thing to do.
Instead you should detect the specific features you actually want to
use.  (As an example, if you wanted to issue Xen hypervisor commands
you would look for the C</proc/xen/privcmd> file).

However people keep asking for this, so we provide it.  There are a
few legitimate uses:

=over 4

=item Bug reporting tool

If you think that virtualization could affect how your program runs,
then you might use C<virt-what> to report this in a bug reporting
tool.

=item Status display and monitoring tools

You might include this information in status and monitoring programs.
